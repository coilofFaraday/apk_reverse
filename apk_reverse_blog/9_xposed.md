# Detailed Introduction to Xposed Framework for Android Applications

Xposed Framework is a popular tool for Android application development that allows developers to modify the behavior of Android applications without the need to modify their source code. In this article, we'll take a detailed look at Xposed Framework and its use in Android application development.

## Introduction to Xposed Framework
Xposed Framework is a tool that allows developers to modify the behavior of Android applications by hooking into their Java code at runtime. This means that developers can modify an application's behavior without the need to modify its source code. The framework consists of two parts: the Xposed Installer app and the Xposed Framework module.

## Using Xposed Framework
To demonstrate the use of Xposed Framework, we'll use our previously created Kotlin app. We'll modify the behavior of the app to always display the message "Logged in as admin" when the user logs in.

First, we'll create an Xposed Framework module. This module will hook into the LoginActivity class of our Kotlin app and modify its behavior. We'll use the XposedBridge API to hook into the LoginActivity class and modify its behavior.

```java
public class MyXposedModule implements IXposedHookLoadPackage {
    @Override
    public void handleLoadPackage(XC_LoadPackage.LoadPackageParam lpparam) throws Throwable {
        if (!lpparam.packageName.equals("com.example.myapp")) {
            return;
        }

        XposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod("com.example.myapp.LoginActivity", lpparam.classLoader, "onCreate", Bundle.class, new XC_MethodHook() {
            @Override
            protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {
                super.afterHookedMethod(param);
                TextView textView = (TextView) ((Activity) param.thisObject).findViewById(R.id.textView);
                textView.setText("Logged in as admin");
            }
        });
    }
}
```

Next, we'll install our Xposed Framework module using the Xposed Installer app. Once installed, we can launch our Kotlin app and verify that the message "Logged in as admin" is always displayed when the user logs in.

## Using Xposed Framework to Bypass Login Activity
Now, let's modify the behavior of the app to bypass the login activity entirely. To do this, we'll hook into the LoginActivity class again, but this time we'll modify the behavior of the onResume method to immediately start the MainActivity class.

```java
XposedHelpers.findAndHookMethod("com.example.myapp.LoginActivity", lpparam.classLoader, "onResume", new XC_MethodHook() {
    @Override
    protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {
        super.afterHookedMethod(param);
        Intent intent = new Intent();
        intent.setClassName("com.example.myapp", "com.example.myapp.MainActivity");
        ((Activity) param.thisObject).startActivity(intent);
    }
});
```

Now, when we launch our Kotlin app, we'll be taken directly to the MainActivity without having to enter any login credentials.

## Conclusion
Xposed Framework is a powerful tool for Android application development that allows developers to modify the behavior of Android applications without the need to modify their source code. By using Xposed Framework, developers can add features to their applications, bypass security measures, and patch vulnerabilities. By understanding the use of Xposed Framework in Android application development, developers can better protect their applications from attacks and add features to their applications.
